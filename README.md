# Example Event Sourced airline reservation application.

Built on top of Eventide - event-sourcing Ruby toolkit.

This is a monorepo with multiple services. To simplify working flow, services in this monorepo are tightly coupled and refer each other by relative path on file-system. (I guess it does not work on Windows, sorry).


To run this application.


TODO: setup script.

Iterate over services. run install_gems.

+ MongoDB
+ Postgresql

TODO: start script 

Iterate over services. run start.





Issues:

1) Wolfgang rereads commands from stream and reissues events.
